    + CTG about a contig
    + STR "structured header line"
    + GEN generic
      
** "Master" object
   The "root" struct is the ~hdr_hdr_t~ which is constructed via ~bcf_hdr_read~ on the ~htsFile~.
   
  This struct stores 3 key-value hashes for :
  1) ID
  2) Contig
  3) Sample

  Each of these can be iterated by iterating the three ~bcf_idpair_t~ arrays (which are of size ~n[0],n[1],n[2]~ respectively)

  I believe that alternatively, if you know the header fields you are interested in, you can get their id
  using the bcf_hdr_id2int.  You
